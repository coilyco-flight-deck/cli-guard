// Package sudo is policy-free plumbing for driving an interactive
// sudo over an ssh transport without either (a) carrying a password
// at rest or (b) leaking it through argv or the audit log.

// The hot path on a configured server is `sudo -n` against a NOPASSWD
// sudoers entry, which never reaches this package. ReadPassword runs
// only when -n is denied and an interactive fallback is required.
